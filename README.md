# DCGAN
This is one of the projects for the Current Topics in Artificial Intelligence course at VUW, involving the construction and training of a DCGAN(Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks) model, and ultimately using the Generator to produce corresponding images.

The code is in AIML431_assignment4.ipynb, or please refer to Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dQGyb91vSZ_T8bM4OBE_xAKfEYxnmS8F?usp=sharing

The model is roughly depicted in the following diagram. As I don't have a copy of the course materials, I found a similar image for reference.
